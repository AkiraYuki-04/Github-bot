## Installation üîß

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:


-git clone <https://github.com/AkiraYuki-04/Github-bot.git>

-cd Github-bot


2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required dependencies using npm:

This will install the following libraries:

(moment) -for date manipulation.

(simple-git) - for interacting with Git repositories.

(jsonfile) - for writing to the data.json file.

(random)  - for generating random numbers.



3. Set Up GitHub Access üîê
To authenticate your bot with GitHub, make sure your GitHub access is properly set up. You can use either HTTPS or SSH for authentication.

Example for HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://<username>:<token>@github.com/<username>/Github-bot.git

Make sure to replace <username> with your GitHub username and <token> with your GitHub personal access token.


4. Create a Personal Access Token (If Using HTTPS)
If you're using HTTPS authentication, you‚Äôll need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

Go to [GitHub  Tokens  <https://github.com/settings/tokens>].

Create a new token with repo scope.

Use this token in your git remote set-url command.
