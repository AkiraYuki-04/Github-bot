## Features üéâ

- Automatically makes commits to a GitHub repository.

## Installation üîß

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:


-git clone <https://github.com/AkiraYuki-04/Github-bot.git>

-cd Github-bot


2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required dependencies using npm:


-npm install

This will install the following libraries:

(moment) -for date manipulation.

(simple-git) - for interacting with Git repositories.

(jsonfile) - for writing to the data.json file.

(random)  - for generating random numbers.



3. Set Up GitHub Access üîê
To authenticate your bot with GitHub, make sure your GitHub access is properly set up. You can use either HTTPS or SSH for authentication.

Example for HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://<username>:<token>@github.com/<username>/Github-bot.git

Make sure to replace <username> with your GitHub username and <token> with your GitHub personal access token.


4. Create a Personal Access Token (If Using HTTPS)
If you're using HTTPS authentication, you‚Äôll need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

Go to [GitHub  Tokens  <https://github.com/settings/tokens>].

Create a new token with repo scope.

Use this token in your git remote set-url command.

Usage üöÄ
Once everything is set up, you can run the bot script to make commits:

-node index.js

The bot will make multiple commits to the data.json file with random commit dates within the last year. You can configure the number of commits in the script, such as makeCommits(100) to make 100 commits.
